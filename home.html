    <div class="para">

        <p>India is well-known for its many artistic and cultural traditions. From ancient times, numerous groups have passed the ideas and inventions from one generation to the next generation. Local people have their own methods of surviving as well as their own concepts and values. This type of information is now commonly referred to as "traditional knowledge". The knowledge is known as traditional not only because it is ancient or inactive but it is considered traditional because it plays a vital and dynamic role in many societies' modern lives. Every day, new traditional knowledge is formed, and it changes as people and groups react to the difficulties presented by their social surroundings.</p>
        
        <p>Traditional knowledge is basically culture oriented and it is an essential part of the cultural identity of specific generation and is passed down through the generations. A broad definition of "traditional knowledge" includes works of literature, art, or science based on tradition; performances; inventions; scientific discoveries; designs; marks, names, and symbols; undisclosed information; and any other works of literature, art, or science based on tradition that are the product of intellectual activity. But there is a huge difference between knowledge and skills. The knowledge is the familiarity with actual facts, but skills are the capacity to apply knowledge to particular contexts. Numerous foreign countries were drawn to the Indian subcontinent due to its traditional knowledge and talents. However, it also makes a significant contribution to the advancement of global scientific legacy. The growth of many colors and fragrances, among other things, demonstrated that the ancient Indians possessed these abilities. The development of trigonometry, various cloth-making techniques, and other innovations are strikingly authentic instances of ancient Indian science and technology.</p>
        
        <p>India provides some of the most priceless cultural legacies to the world, which includes Alchemical, martial arts, metal-casting, zero algebra, and many other skills. It is not possible to cover it in a single project. The present project report deals with the India traditional skills like ancient temple architecture, wooden work, metal work, terracotta and leather craft and transitional musical practices and its origin. The complete work is divided in Six chapter.</p>

        <p><strong>Chapter 1 titled "Indian Temple architecture"</strong> deals with the basic structure and technologies used in construction of temples and other buildings in ancient India. Indian temples have represented the ancient people's entire way of life for ages. Indian temple constructions are a live example of the ancient peoples' sophisticated knowledge in several scientific fields and their building prowess. Ancient Indian temple architecture is influenced by regional and dynasty styles. Ancient writings on temple construction and related areas include the Shilpashastras, Brihatsamhita, Mayamata, Shilparatna, Kamik agama, and Kashyapa Shilpa.</p>

        <p>The temple designs, ranges from the intricate sculptures of southern Indian temples to the intimidating arrows found in northern Indian temples, are a mix of several architectural traditions.</p>

        <p>The modern world is still in admiration of and inspired by the engineering expertise of the Ancient Indian technologies. Even if contemporary engineers have access to cutting-edge tools and materials, they can nevertheless benefit from some important insights from the clever builders of antiquity. Ancient engineers were able to construct amazing constructions even in the absence of contemporary equipment and tools. They believed in the efficacy of simplicity, employing fundamental ideas to produce astounding outcomes. It is possible for contemporary engineers to recognize the beauty in simplicity and incorporate it into their designs.</p>

        <p>Indian temples are built using high-quality materials and sound construction procedures, which contribute to their long lifespan. Stone and wood from the local area are used to build the temple, giving it a more distinctive appearance and a link to the surroundings. Durability is something that modern engineers should put first by selecting materials that will last and creating structures that can withstand extreme weather and natural calamities. Their considerate approach to environmental preservation and sophisticated water management systems serve as a model for contemporary engineers to developed sustainable technologies. Reducing the environmental impact of construction projects and preserving natural resources can be achieved by incorporating sustainability into design. The importance of craftsmanship is shown by the elaborate sculptures and carvings discovered in ancient temples. The old builders' meticulous attention to detail serves as a reminder that quality and aesthetics are both important aspects of workmanship. In their projects, modern engineers should understand and value the value of expert craftsmanship. Skills like wooden and metal work, terracotta and leather work were explain in other chapters of the project.</p>

        <p>Indian temple architecture continues to draw tourists and devotees from all over the world, providing a window into the country's rich religious, historical, and architectural traditions. They offer a space for prayer, introspection, and taking part in religious rites and celebrations. In most of these publications, the issue is handled under three primary headings: geographical distribution, construction regulations and materials, and fundamental procedures involved in building temples.</p>

        <p>Traditional Indian wood work and carving is explain the <strong>Chapter 2 tilted "Ancient Wood work"</strong>. Wood carving has been practiced in India for a long time, despite the fact that traditionally wood has been used to make home posts, rafters, yokes, ploughs, toys, planks, and furniture, among other things. India has a huge craze for wooden handicrafts due to their aesthetic value and beauty. India is home to a wide variety of trees. The production of wooden handicrafts involved the use of these various tree varieties. India's wooden handicrafts are renowned for their elegance and practicality. These handicrafts include accessories, furniture, boxes, beads, and figures with intricate engravings. India is a tropical nation with forests that are either deciduous or evergreen. A substantial quantity of wood was utilized, sourced from bamboo trees, Sheesham trees, Alpine forests, and trees native to arid regions. In addition to the wooden furniture, lovely toys, picture frames, dolls, wall hangings, ornamental vases, and showpieces were also created. One of the most prominent forms of art is the decorating and carving of wood. Houses are decorated with wooden handicrafts. From the advanced woodworking techniques of the Indus Valley Civilization to the intricately carved temples of the Chola and Vijayanagara periods, the history of woodwork in ancient India is a testament to the nation's artistic heritage. The Vedic period emphasized the sacred role of wood in rituals, while the Maurya and Gupta empires witnessed the incorporation of wood in palace and temple architecture. Both the magnificent temple at Bodh Gaya and the palace of Emperor Asoka in Pataliputra were constructed out of wood.</p>

        <p>From ancient time India have an abundant variety of woodworking materials. Kashmiri wooden artifacts fabricated from walnut and deodar wood, has grown from 11 century A.D. Gujrat is famous for its lyrical and exquisite wooden work which includes ornate doors, windows, and projection balconies. Kerala's graceful tharavad houses were famous for its rich brown teakwood architecture. Kerala is also known for producing exquisitely carved religious statues. Kumbli wood is used to create elephants in a various sizes and poses. Himachal Pradesh is famous for their exquisite wood-carving traditions and style known as dori, jali, kutheri phool, and naghbel, which were seen in their temples. Bhimakali Temple in Sarahan district is one of the best examples of wood carving in Himanchal Pradesh.</p>

        <p>In Karnataka's sandalwood is used to carve statues of gods and goddesses, daily used artifacts and boxes. Rakatachandan, (Red sandal wood) used to sculpt dolls and deity figurines in Andhra Pradesh.  Solid blocks of jackfruit wood are used to carve the spectacular wood sculptures of the coastal Karnataka-based Bhuta cult of ancestor worship. Also various types of wood, including sisam, sal, and dudhi, are used for wood carving in Uttar Pradesh.</p>

        <p>In India, scenes from the Epics, especially those from the battlefield, forest, and palace, along with representations of deities are frequently carved out of wood. The wood used for the wood carvings of the tribes in the Northeast is called kumisyng in the area. Of all the carved items, the enormous wood drum is the most remarkable. Assamese fashion and accessories such as the namghar or kirtanghar (a wooden house), hukkas, sandals, and book rests are well-known. Doors, window frames, "marriage-litters", wedding pillars, tobacco cases, and pipes items carved out of wood in the tribal regions of Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa, and Rajasthan. Rajasthan's palaces and havelis boast doors and windows with intricate and vast woodcarving.</p>

        <p><strong>Chapter 3 (Metal Work in Ancient India)</strong> deals with the Metalwork and metal fabrication. India have a long history in India and go back thousands of years. Metalworking was practiced by several ancient civilizations in India, including the Indus Valley Civilization and the Vedic Age. The literature and the metal representations found during archaeology excavations confirm that bronze casting has been a continuous practice in India for over 5,000 years. Indian metal smiths are renowned for their many techniques in the art of metalworking, and they have crafted forms with the vision, ideation, and empathy of sculptors. The first non-ferrous metals that humans used were copper and tin. These were eventually combined to create an alloy known as bronze.   The Matsya-Purana explains how to cast bronze images in several ways. The description of iron production from minerals using smelting process is demonstrated in "Rigveda", previously iron was named as "KRSN Ayask" in vedas. Thus, India has greater significance in production of iron, the tools and equipment's that were used is produced have evidence in Vedas. India, with its vast archaeological and cultural legacy, has rightfully earned a unique place in the globe. The Indian subcontinent is home to numerous historical locations that are endowed with ancient temples, monuments, and other relics such as coins, sculptures, pillars, and more. These artifacts speak volumes about the exquisite craftsmanship of the ancient Indian artisans. This demonstrates how rich in ethical and philosophical traditions Indian culture was, as well as how far along it was in terms of financial affluence. The evolution of human materialization during the Stone, Bronze, and Iron periods can be seen as three major, chronological stages of human development.</p>

        <p>The Copper-stone era, also known as the Chalcolithic period, spanned roughly 2000-700 BCE and was a part of the Saraswati-Sindhu civilization. Chalco means copper, Lithic means stone, so as the name implies, both copper and stone were employed in the Chalcolithic era to prepare tools. Tools, beads, bangles, and other items were made from copper and its alloy, bronze. According to discoveries at sites like Mohenjo-Daro in Sindh and Harappa in Punjab, the most advanced stage of this civilization, also known as the Bronze-age Harappan Civilization, was flourishing between approximately 2500 and 1800 BCE and was scattered throughout a broad area of the Indian subcontinent. Iron age in India was belong between period between 1200- 600 BCE. Because iron ores were significantly more accessible than copper ores and could be produced at a lower cost than copper and bronze, iron was replacing their copper and bronze equivalents on a growing basis. Individuals started with the intentional burning of iron ore with charcoal to produce iron, which was then used to make tools and weapons. The Vedic scriptures, which date from approximately 1500 BCE to 500 BCE, discuss the technology used in India to make iron and steel. The Susruta Samhita describes the heat treatment process to produce sharp edges and the method of fabricating over a hundred surgical instruments from Fe-C alloys around 700 BCE.</p>

        <p>Rasa Ratna Samuccaya (c. 1200-800 CE) also mentions the procedure of extracting iron and alloying iron-carbon. It was found that Fe-C alloy is classified in three different categories namely Kanta Loha, Trishna Loha and Munda Loha. These alloys were also known as soft iron, carbon steel and cast iron. Khargalakshan's process of carburizing and hardening iron swords is described by Varahamihira. India has an abundance of iron ore that is suitable for smelting, due to this reason smelting of iron became a widely recognized industry in that country. Iron production has been documented in several regions of India, indicating a rich technological legacy dating back thousands of years. Among the most well-known metallurgists in ancient India was Nagarjuna. His ability to turn metal into gold is what has made him most famous. Moreover, Arabic and Indian metallurgy appear to be comparable. Indian metallurgy was abundant in highly trained artisans and more efficient methods describe in the antiquated work "Rasratnakar". It clarified the liquid matter primarily. It provided an accurate explanation of mercury's properties.</p>

        <p>Ancient Indian metallurgy stands as a testament to ingenuity. From the sacred fires emerged a metallurgical artistry, shaping civilizations and cultural identities. A remarkable example of ancient Indian metallurgy such as Delhi iron pillar, Dhar Pillar, Sun Temple and Zinc Zawar Mine are taking a very important place in ancient Indian heritage. A detailed description of these ancient monuments, their engineering design and production process has been explained in detail. There has been discussion over the pillar's iron properties and the potential cause of its high phosphorus level. The relevance of the protective passive film mechanism has been emphasized, and the ideas pertaining to the pillar's corrosion resistance have been examined. The Delhi iron pillar's resistance to corrosion stems from both iron's high phosphorus content and Delhi's atmosphere, which alternates between wet and dry conditions. The ancient Indian blacksmiths' methods of producing tools and utensils are still used today. The technique which had been used for production of these specious monuments such as solid-state reduction of iron, Forging technique, downward distillation process for collection of Zinc by Ancient Indian black smithers, explained briefly. It was found that ancient Indian metallurgist have wide knowledge of smithing, forging, identification and extraction from precious minerals, adverse knowledge of alloying different element, and their importance in fabrication. Indigenous brilliance, forging legacies and timeless alchemy of ancient Indian metallurgist are still unnoticed and the part of study further in future.</p>

        <p>The origins of many art forms may be traced back to the Vedas, which have long been revered as the primary source of Indian cultural history. The Vedic Era corresponds to the period in ancient Indian art history. It is evident that the archaeology department does not possess any art evidence. However, numerous locations in our historical literature make reference to various forms, types, and expressions of art. The term "Shilp" was first used during the Vedic era, and it is mentioned in two forms, one of which is Lalit kal. Within the realm of Lalit kala, which encompasses fine arts, there are discussions pertaining to music, singing, painting, and poetry. Another classification, referred to as Upyogi kala or commercial art, may be subdivided into two distinct forms: colouring and building. In the present project <strong>Chapter 4 and 5 deals with the Terracotta and leather shilp</strong>. Terracotta is an ancient artistic medium, potentially one of the earliest manifestations of human creativity. The incorporation of the five elements - air, water, earth, fire, and ether - in Terracotta art imbues it with an enigmatic and propitious quality, in accordance with Hindu beliefs. Archaeological excavations at various sites of the Indus Valley Civilization, such as Birhana, Mehrgarh, and Mohenjodaro, have unearthed terracotta figurines depicting mother goddesses, male deities, and terracotta cart frames and wheels. These artefacts, dating back to approximately 7000 BC, provide evidence that this form of art thrived in the Indian subcontinent prior to its adoption in other regions. Terracotta played a significant role in the commercial endeavours of this ancient civilization. Merchants utilised terracotta seals to imprint their insignia, which often featured intricately carved depictions of humans or animals. These seals also portray the clothing, hairstyles, jewellery, and religious beliefs of the people, in addition to providing insight into the script they used.</p>

        <p>Tannin from leather is claimed to be the earliest activity ever performed by humans. Before, the skins that were collected from hunting could be used for clothing or for creating tents. However, when exposed to temperatures that caused them to become rigid and rot, animal fat was rubbed into the skin in order to prevent this from happening. This made the skin more flexible and stronger. Smoking was another procedure that almost started out as an accident and eventually evolved into formaldehyde tanning.</p>

        <p>This is an old hereditary craft with a wide prevalence in the rural areas of India. Leather tanning as an art form reached its zenith in India by 3000 B.C. The earliest skins used were those of tigers and deer. Mats made out of the animal skins were used by rishis and sadhus in the olden days.</p>

        <p>The footwear category in India contains the most leather goods. The traditional ones are typically embroidered, covered in brocade, or embellished with colorful textiles. They are also more unique, individualistic, and colorful. Maharashtra is the place where the incredibly cozy and stylish Kolhapuri chappals are manufactured. The Mojadi, often called lutti, is a stylish type of footwear that is among Rajasthan's most well-known leather goods. Hyderabad's Saleemshahi Jootas are well-known. In this instance, the leather is sewn, punched, embroidered, and studded with a variety of striking patterns. Jaipur and Jodhpur are the most well-known locations for traditional footwear. Specialty of the Bikaner people is Kupi, a bottle made of camel hide used to store oil or "attar" (perfume). Manoti art uses camel hides to create items like lamps and lampshades. The hides are colored, embellished with figures and floral patterns, and then coated with thin gold leaves. Kashmiri leatherwork is incredibly ornate. appliqué made in Punjab from pieces of colored leather. Karnataka is renowned for its leather that has been painted with people or animals, usually creating epic scenarios, or has a metallic gold or silvery finish. The silk and gold embroidery on red leather from Madhya Pradesh is distinctive. Interesting items made of crocodile and snake skins include belts, purses, wallets, and handbags. Bookbinding also makes great use of leatherwork.</p>

        <p>This may be found in the vapours that are formed when green leaves and branches are burned. Following this discovery, it was discovered how to prevent the rotting of leather by the drying or dehydrating action of salt. Moreover, the tanning of vegetables was known. It was during the 12th century that there were advancements made in the processing technology. In order to improve the leather's look and its capacity to be moulded, oil tanning and finishing were performed on it. There is a type of material known as leather that is both extremely tough and flexible. Through the processing of animal skin, it may be obtained. After the skins have been treated and put through a number of different processes, they are then used in the production of leather goods.</p>

        <p>The country of India is responsible for the production of a wide variety of leather-based items. The following are some examples of items that fall under this category: trunks, suitcases, vanity cases, handbags, wallets, purses, passport holders, cardholders, diary covers, belts and hats. Leather may be found in a wide variety of types, each of which is distinguished by its distinctive surface textures and vibrant hues. The lifespan of the things that are made from leather gives the joy of working with leather since they endure longer than the years that textiles do.</p>

        <p>The creation of handcrafted leather items is a genuine artistry that needs expertise, perseverance, and meticulousness. The production of artisanal leather goods is not simply a process of manufacturing, but rather a labour-intensive undertaking that necessitates the skilled hands of brilliant craftsmen. From the careful selection of high-quality materials to the precise execution of cutting, stitching, and finishing, every stage of the process demonstrates the commitment and skill involved in producing a handmade leather product. Ancient India was renowned for its production of leather goods, which involved processes such as tanning, dyeing, and tooling to create durable and decorative items. By opting for handcrafted leather goods and bags, you will be endorsing skilled artists who are committed to their trade and producing durable, environmentally-friendly, and one-of-a-kind things that you will cherish indefinitely.</p>

        <p>The final chapter 6 deals with the Origin of Ancient India music and instruments. Through the arts, man has attempted throughout history to communicate the stirrings of his soul and his quest for something more than the ordinary. Since music is audible, there is no analogous evidence for the evolution of poetry, painting, or other visual arts, which have been preserved on stone, leaves, and paper. Despite the wide range of cultural exchanges, our music has stayed primarily melodious. Harmony involves the superposition of musical sounds on top of one another, whereas melody involves the following note to create a continuous unity of effect. The melodic quality of our classical music has not diminished.</p>

        <p>The Hindustani and Carnatic classical music systems are the two that are now recognized. Only Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh have traditional music. Hindustani Classical Music is the term used to describe the classical music of the rest of the nation. Of course, the Hindustani Classical method is also used in some parts of Andhra and Karnataka. In the recent past, Karnataka has produced several extremely notable Hindustani musicians.</p>

        <p>Beyond its sociocultural significance, music is spiritual, religious, and ceremonial in nature. It can be used as a channel for prayer to ask God for health. Chanting and music can be used as techniques for relaxation, meditation, and maintaining a balanced body, mind, and soul. India has long had a tradition of using music to effect change. The majority of Indian religions has included music and chanting from the beginning and still do. Singing and listening to religious hymns is believed to promote mental and spiritual healing, and ancient Hindu writings discuss the use of hymns for healing illness.</p>

        <p>"Various musical treatment approaches are also included in Indian traditional systems of health and healing." Ayurveda is among the most well-known traditional Indian medicinal techniques. Ayurveda, which translates to "the science of life", was developed in India in 500 B.C. Hinduism is the source of Indian classical music, which is based on old texts. Through equilibrium between the doshas, or constituents of the human body, identified as vata (air), pitta (fire), and kapha (water and earth) it seeks to facilitate healing. Oral traditions are the source of Indian classical music; Carnatic music is primarily heard in South India, whereas Hindustani music is heard more frequently in North India. Both forms, which are based on the archaic raga, rasa, and tala system, have lengthy and complex improvisations that prioritize text, melody, rhythm, and improvisation.</p>

        <p>Since the beginning of civilization music was in our society. So many instruments were found in Harappan civilization as well. In Vedic age stringed instruments were quite popular. Instruments are important part of music in all its forms. From Vena, Sitar, Damru, Flute and like instruments the Vedic period is full of musical approach. When Sabdabrahma started from sky and Shiva had created 14 words from his Damru, music started. Our ancient Gurukulas were expert in 64 Kalas & first skilled given to any student was Music only. All 64 Kalas were categorized in different stages & steps for improving the creativity of students. Till 13th century music and musical instruments were totally Vedic period oriented. After 13th centaury single music system were divided into two main categories as Hindustani & Karnatak music. After 18th centaury the Golden era of music started. Indian music is not an exemption to this rule either. The art music and folk music of India feature an extensive range of instruments. From Ancient to modern, Indian culture has always enriched the music. Lot more musical activity and development begin. Different types of ragas and musical instruments were developed and slowly slowly technology had created a space in the world of music system.</p>

        <p>Music itself is very creative for students and all human society. Indian culture had given all the seven sauras of music since long. In modern advance communication age, music can be treated as a therapy also. This Music therapy having huge scope of treatment for diseases without any medicine. Music therapy is going to be an integral part of human being in upcoming years. Music therapy is directly associated with different ragas at different point of time for different diseases. This therapy can directly ignite the respective nervous system of body to cure that particular disease. Mental illness, acidity, asthma like long history disease can be cured by this music therapy.</p>

        <p>To ensure that traditional knowledge data is appropriately integrated and acknowledged as pertinent non-patent literature, certain of those features can need for specific methods. The main threat to the survival of many of these communities today is the emergence of new technology and the new applications of conventional knowledge-based products. Without the communities' consent or profit sharing, the contemporary cultural and manufacturing sectors increasingly commercially exploit traditional knowledge-based products using new technologies. The creation of new products or innovative uses for already-existing ones allows the sectors to get official product protection.</p>
